# Crypto Token Info Query

Welcome to Crypto Token Info Query! This web application empowers you to query and analyze cryptocurrency tokens across various blockchains, enhanced with AI-powered insights.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Token Analysis:**
    - Fetches real-time market data for tokens on Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE) blockchains. This includes price, symbol, name, and logo, primarily through OKX integration.
    - Uses AI (OpenAI/GPT via OpenRouter) to provide deeper insights into token data. (Note: AI insights aim to summarize token information, assess potential risks, and evaluate prospects based on available data.)
- **Multi-Blockchain Support:** Currently supports Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE).
- **Secure Access:** API endpoints are protected by an access code.
- **Query History:** Track your past token queries with Supabase integration.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS for a responsive design, Zod for form validation, and TypeScript for robust, type-safe code.

## Token Analysis In-Depth

This core feature offers a detailed look at cryptocurrency tokens by combining live market data with AI-generated analysis.

### Overview
The token analysis tool helps you quickly understand a token's current market performance and potential future outlook. It achieves this by fetching real-time data and providing AI-driven interpretations.

### Data Sources
- **Market Data:** Key information like real-time price, symbol, name, and other token details are primarily sourced from the OKX exchange API.
- **AI Insights:** Advanced analysis, such as summaries, risk assessments, and potential evaluations, is generated by large language models (OpenAI's GPT series) accessed via OpenRouter.

### Information Provided
When you analyze a token, you will typically receive:
- **Basic Token Details:**
    - Current Price (in USD)
    - Token Symbol (e.g., SOL)
    - Token Name (e.g., Solana)
    - Decimals (precision of the token)
    - Logo URL (if available)
- **AI-Powered Analysis:**
    - **Summary:** A brief overview of the token's main features and its position in the market.
    - **Risk Assessment:** An evaluation of potential risks tied to the token, based on factors like market sentiment (if detectable) and other available data.
    - **Potential Evaluation:** An outlook on the token's potential, considering its fundamentals and the broader market context.
    - *(Please note: The specifics of AI analysis are dynamic and may evolve. Our goal is always to provide actionable and relevant insights.)*

### How to Use
1. Go to the token query section of the application.
2. Choose the blockchain (e.g., Solana, Base).
3. Type in the token's contract address.
4. Click "Submit" to view the analysis.

### Interpreting the Results
The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only. While our AI aims to deliver accurate and insightful analysis, it should not be taken as financial advice. Always cross-reference information and conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need:
- Node.js (version 16.x or newer)
- Bun (recommended for package management) or npm
- A Supabase account (for database and query history)
- An OpenRouter API key (for AI-powered analysis)

## Environment Variables

Before starting, create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Copy the example from `.env.example` (if available) or use the template below, filling in your actual credentials:

```env
# Supabase - Get these from your Supabase project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY # Important: Keep this secret!

# OpenRouter - Get this from your OpenRouter dashboard
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# Twitter API via RapidAPI (Optional, if you integrate Twitter features)
RAPID_API_KEY=YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY

# OKX API - For fetching market data
OKX_API_KEY=YOUR_OKX_API_KEY
OKX_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_OKX_SECRET_KEY
OKX_PASSPHRASE=YOUR_OKX_PASSPHRASE
PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID # Optional for OKX, check their API docs

# Access Code - A simple password to protect your API endpoints
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_CODE=YOUR_CHOSEN_ACCESS_CODE

# Application URL - The base URL where your app is running
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Or your deployed app URL
```

**Note on OKX API Access:**
1.  Register at OKX and create API keys at [https://www.okx.com/account/my-api](https://www.okx.com/account/my-api).
2.  Ensure you enable **reading permissions** for the API key.
3.  Store your API key, secret key, and passphrase securely in the `.env` file.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/volcanicll/Crypto-Token-Info-Query
    cd Crypto-Token-Info-Query
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using Bun (recommended):
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    Or using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    - Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    - In your Supabase project's SQL Editor, run the SQL commands found in `supabase.sql` (you'll need to create this file or get it from the project maintainer if it's not in the repo).
    - Add your Supabase URL and keys to your `.env` file.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    Using Bun:
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
    Or using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
